This is a very limited wrapper for MMEAPI. I have implemented only the functions I needed for my projects. 

It handles the creation of structs so the code is easy to understand and maintain, the bulk of operations being hidden. Included here is a tiny console app for setting the volume of a device (in this case, the last on in the device list).
